Overview
========
Delicious (http://del.icio.us/) bindings for Ruby.  You'll need to
create an account at Delicious in order to use Rubilicious.  An
RDoc-generated API reference is in doc/, and some simple examples are in
examples/.

Note: If you're upgrading from version 0.1.x, please read the file
"release_notes-0.2.0.txt" for information about several API changes.


Requirements
============
* Ruby (http://www.ruby-lang.org/), version 1.8.0 (or newer).

(Yup, that's it!)


Installation
============
The easiest way to install is via RubyGems (http://rubygems.org/).  If
you've got RubyGems, installing Rubilicious is simple.  Here's how:

    # install rubilicious using RubyGems
    sudo gem install rubilicious

or, without sudo:

    # install rubilicious using RubyGems, without sudo
    su -c 'gem install rubilicious'

If you don't use RubyGems, you can still install Rubilicious directly
with the tarball like this: 

    # install rubilicious directly, without RubyGems
    sudo cp -v rubilicious.rb $(ruby -e 'puts $LOAD_PATH.first')

No sudo?  No problem.  Here's the same command without sudo:

    # install rubilicious directly, without RubyGems or sudo
    su -c "cp -v rubilicious.rb $(ruby -e 'puts $LOAD_PATH.first')"
